<h2 class="padtop">CAPTAIN RICHARD INGLE,</h2>

<h3>THE MARYLAND &ldquo;PIRATE AND REBEL.&rdquo;</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the
American colonies, from Massachusetts to
South Carolina, were at intervals subject to
visitations of pirates, who were wont to appear
suddenly upon the coasts, to pillage a settlement
or attack trading vessels and as suddenly to take
flight to their strongholds. Captain Kidd was
long celebrated in prose and verse, and only within
a few years have credulous people ceased to seek
his buried treasures. The arch-villain, Blackbeard,
was a terror to Virginians and Carolinians
until Spotswood, of &ldquo;Horseshoe&rdquo; fame, took the
matter in hand, and sent after him lieutenant
Maynard, who, slaying the pirate in hand to hand
conflict, returned with his head at the bowsprit.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Lapse of time has cast a romantic and semi-mythologic
glamor around these depredators, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
it is in many instances at this day extremely difficult
to distinguish fact from fiction. The unprotected
situation of many settlements along the
seaboard colonies rendered them an easy prey to
rapacious sea rovers, but it might have been
expected that the Maryland shores of the Chesapeake
bay would be free from their harassings.
The province, however, it seems was not to enjoy
such good fortune, for in the <em>printed</em> annals of her
life appears the name of one man, who has been
handed down from generation to generation as a
&ldquo;pirate,&rdquo; a &ldquo;rebel&rdquo; and an &ldquo;ungrateful villain,&rdquo;
and other equally complimentary epithets have
been applied to him. The original historians of
Maryland based their ideas about him upon some
of the statements made by those whom he had
injured or attacked, and who differed from him in
political creed. The later history writers have
been satisfied to follow such authors as Bozman,
McMahon and McSherry, or to copy them directly,
without consulting original records. To the general
reader, therefore, who relies upon these authorities,
Richard Ingle is &ldquo;a pirate and rebel&rdquo; still.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A thorough defence of him would be almost
impossible in view of the comparative scarcity
of records and the complicated politics of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
time. In a review of his relations with Maryland,
however, and by a presentation of all the
facts, some light may be thrown upon his general
character, and explanations, if not a defence, of his
acts may be made.</p>

<p>Richard Ingle&rsquo;s name first appears in the records
of Maryland under date of March 23rd, 1641/2, when
he petitioned the Assembly against Giles Brent
touching the serving of an execution by the sheriff.
He had come to the province a few weeks before,
bringing in his vessel Captain Thomas Cornwallis,
one of the original council, the greatest man in
Maryland at that time, who had been spending
some months in England.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Between the time of
his arrival and the date of his petition Ingle had
no doubt been plying his business, tobacco trading,
in the inlets and rivers of the province. No further
record of him in Maryland this year has been
preserved, but Winthrop wrote that on May 3rd,
1642, &ldquo;The ship Eleanor of London one Mr.
|| Inglee || master arrived at Boston she was laden
with tobacco from Virginia, and having been about
14 days at sea she was taken with such a tempest,
that though all her sails were down and made up,
yet they were blown from the yards and she was
laid over on one side two and a half hours, so low
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
as the water stood upon her deck and the sea over-raking
her continually and the day was as dark as
if it had been night, and though they had cut her
masts, yet she righted not till the tempest assuaged.
She staid here till the 4th of the (4) and was well
fitted with masts, sails, rigging and victuals at such
reasonable rates as that the master was much
affected with his entertainment and professed that
he never found the like usage in Virginia where he
had traded these ten years.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Although his name
is given an additional <em>e</em> and there are some few
seeming discrepancies, the facts taken together
point to the probability of his being Richard Ingle
on his return voyage to England. Next year he
was again in Maryland, and, as attorney for Mr.
Penniston and partners, sued widow Cockshott for
debts incurred by her husband. The next entry in
the &ldquo;Provincial Records&rdquo; under this date, March
6th, 1642/3, is an attachment against William Hardige
in case of Captain Cornwallis.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This William
Hardige, who was afterward one of Ingle&rsquo;s chief
accusers, was very frequently involved in suits for
debts to Cornwallis, and others. About the middle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
of the month of January, 1643/4, the boatswain
of the &ldquo;Reformation&rdquo; brought against Hardige a
suit for tobacco, returnable February 1st. Three
days afterward a warrant was issued to William
Hardige, a tailor, for the arrest of Ingle for high
treason, and Captain Cornwallis was bidden to aid
Hardige, and the matter was to be kept secret.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Ingle was arrested and given into the custody of
Edward Parker, the sheriff, by the lieutenant general
of the province, Giles Brent, who also seized
Ingle&rsquo;s goods and ship, until he should clear himself,
and placed on board, under John Hampton, a
guard ordered to allow no one to come on the ship
without a warrant from the lieutenant general.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Then was published, and as the records seem to
show, fixed on the vessel&rsquo;s mainmast the following
proclamation.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;These are to publish &amp; <ins class="abbr" title="proclaym">pclaym</ins> to all <ins class="abbr" title="persons">psons</ins>
as well seamen as others, that Richard Ingle, <ins class="abbr" title="master">m<sup>r</sup></ins> of
his ship, is arrested upon highe treason to his
<ins class="abbr" title="Majesty">Ma<sup>ty</sup></ins>; &amp; therefore to require all <ins class="abbr" title="persons">psons</ins> to be aiding
&amp; assisting to his <ins class="abbr" title="Lordships">Lo<sup>ps</sup></ins> officers in the seizing of his
ship, &amp; not to offer any resistance or contempt
hereunto, nor be any otherwaise aiding or assisting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
to the said Richard Ingle upon perl of highe
treason to his <ins class="abbr" title="Majesty">Ma<sup>ty</sup></ins>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this proclamation Ingle escaped
in the following manner. Parker had no prison,
and, consequently, had to keep personal guard
over his prisoner. He supposed, &ldquo;from certain
words spoken by the Secretary,&rdquo; that Brent and
the council had agreed to let Ingle go on board
his vessel, and when Captain Cornwallis and Mr.
Neale came from the council meeting and carried
Ingle to the ship, he accompanied them.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Arrived
on board Cornwallis said &ldquo;All is peace,&rdquo; and persuaded
the commanding officer to bid his men lay
down their arms and disperse, and then Ingle and
his crew regained possession of the ship. Under
such circumstances the sheriff could not prevent
his escape, especially when a member of the council
and the most influential men in the province
had assisted the deed by their acts or presence.
Besides it was afterwards said that William Durford,
John Durford, and Fred. Johnson, at the
instigation of Ingle, beat and wounded some of
the guard, though this charge does not appear to
have been substantiated.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>On January 20th, 1643/4, the following warrant
was issued to the sheriff.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
&ldquo;I doe hereby require (in his <ins class="abbr" title="Majesties">Ma<sup>ties</sup></ins> name)
Richard Ingle, mariner to yield his body to Rob
Ellyson, Sheriff of this County, before the first of
<ins class="abbr" title="ffebruary">ffebr</ins> next, to answer to such crimes of treason, as
on his <ins class="abbr" title="Majesties">Ma<sup>ties</sup></ins> behalfe shalbe obiected <ins class="abbr" title="against">ag<sup>st</sup></ins> him,
upon his utmost perl, of the Law in that behalfe.
And I doe further require all <ins class="abbr" title="persons">psons</ins> that can say

Richard Ingle to informe his <ins class="abbr" title="Lordships">Lo<sup>ps</sup></ins> Attorny of it
some time before the said Court to the end it may
be then &amp; there prosequuted</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">G. Brent.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Ingle, however, was not again arrested, though
he still remained in the neighborhood of St.
Mary&rsquo;s, for on January 30th his vessel was riding
at anchor in St. George&rsquo;s river, and mention is
made of him in the records as being in the province.
For nearly two months the Ingle question was
agitated and for the sake of clearness an account
will be given of the acts concerning him in the
order of their occurrence.</p>

<p>The information given by Hardige to Lewger
which had caused Ingle&rsquo;s arrest was: that in
March or April, 1642, he heard Ingle, who was then
at Kent Island, and at other times in St. Mary&rsquo;s,
say, that he was &ldquo;Captain of Gravesend for the
Parliament against the King;&rdquo; that he heard
Ingle say that in February of that year he had
been bidden in the King&rsquo;s name to come ashore at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
Accomac, in Virginia, but he, in the parliament&rsquo;s
name had refused to do so, and had threatened to
cut off the head of any one who should come on
his ship.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> On January 29th, Hardige and others
were summoned to appear and to give evidence
of&mdash;here the pirate enters&mdash;&ldquo;pyratical &amp; treasonable
offences&rdquo; of Ingle. On February 1st, the
sheriff impannelled a jury of which Robert
Vaughan was chosen foreman, and witnesses were
sworn, among them Hardige who &ldquo;being excepted
at as infamous,&rdquo; by Capt. Cornwallis, &ldquo;was not
found so.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> John Lewger, the attorney-general,
having stated that the Court had power to take
cognizance of treason out of the province in order
to determine where the offender should be tried,
presented three bills for the jury to consider.
The first bill included the second charge brought
by Hardige, the second ordered the jury to inquire
&ldquo;if on the 20th of November and some daies
afore &amp; since in the 17 yea of his <ins class="abbr" title="Majesties">Ma<sup>ties</sup></ins> reigne at
Gravesend in Comit Kent in England&rdquo; the
accused &ldquo;not having the feare of God before his
eies, but instigated thereunto by the instigation of
the divill &amp; example of other traitors of his <ins class="abbr" title="Majestie">Ma<sup>tie</sup></ins>
traiterously &amp; as an enemy did levie war &amp; beare
armes <ins class="abbr" title="against">ag<sup>st</sup></ins> his <ins class="abbr" title="majestie">ma<sup>tie</sup></ins> and accept &amp; exercise the
comand &amp; captainship of the town of Gravesend,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
and by the third bill they were to inquire if Ingle
did not, on April 5th in the eighteenth year of
Charles&rsquo; reign, on his vessel in the Potomac river,
near St. Clement&rsquo;s island, say, &ldquo;that Prince
Rupert was a rogue or rascall.&rdquo; If the rest of
the testimony was no stronger or more conclusive
than that of Hardige, it is not surprising that the
jury replied to all the bills &ldquo;<em>Ignoramus</em>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Another jury was impannelled to investigate the
charge of Ingle&rsquo;s having broken from the sheriff,
and they returned a like finding. In the afternoon
the first jury were given two more bills, first, to
find &ldquo;whether in April 1643 Ingle, being then at
Mattapanian,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> St. Clement&rsquo;s hundred, said &lsquo;that
Prince Rupert was Prince Traitor &amp; Prince rogue
and if he had him aboard his ship he would whip
him at the capstan.&rsquo;&rdquo; This bill met the fate of
the others, but the second charging him with saying
&ldquo;that the king (meaning <ins class="abbr" title="our">o<sup>r</sup></ins> Gover L.&nbsp;K.
Charles) was no king neither would be no king,
nor could be no king unless he did ioine with the
<ins class="abbr" title="Parlament">Parlam<sup>t</sup></ins>,&rdquo; caused the jury to disagree and no verdict
having been reached at 7 P.&nbsp;M., they adjourned
until the following Saturday.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> On that day,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
February 3rd, at the request of the attorney-general the
jury were discharged and the bill given to another
jury who returned it &ldquo;<em>Ignoramus</em>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In spite of
the unanimity of all the juries in finding no true
indictment, another warrant was issued for the
arrest, by Parker or Ellyson, of Ingle for high
treason, and after a fruitless attempt to secure by
another jury a different finding, Ingle was impeached
on February 8th, for having on January
20th, 1643/4, committed assaults upon the vessels,
guns, goods, and person of one Bishop, and upon
being reproached for these acts, having threatened
to beat down the dwellings of people and even of
Giles Brent, and for &ldquo;the said crimes of pyracie,
mutinie, trespasse, contempt &amp; misdemeanors &amp;
every of them severally.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> If Ingle did commit
these depredations he was, no doubt instigated by
the proceedings instituted on that day against
him, and moreover by the fact that Henry Bishop
had been among the witnesses to be summoned
against him.</p>

<p>Nothing more was done in the matter, for from
a copy of a certificate to Ingle under date of February
8th, it is learned that &ldquo;Upon certaine complaints
exhibited by his <ins class="abbr" title="Lordships">Lo<sup>ps</sup></ins> attorny <ins class="abbr" title="against">ag<sup>st</sup></ins> <ins class="abbr" title="Master">M<sup>r</sup></ins> R.

<p>What a change of policy, from charging a man
with treason, the penalty for which was death, to
offering him the right of bail for the appearance
of his attorney, if necessary, to meet indefinite
charges! In view of all the facts, it seems probable
that the Maryland authorities were committed
to the King&rsquo;s cause by the commission granted by
him to Leonard Calvert in 1643, and by their
action in seizing Ingle; that after his arrest it was
thought to be injudicious to go to extremes, and
that they made little resistance to, if they did not
connive at, his escape. Certainly, efforts to recapture
him must have been very feeble, for when the
sheriff demanded the tobacco and cask due him
from the defendant for summoning juries,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
witnesses, &amp;c., it was found that Ingle had left in the
hands of the Secretary the required amount.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In
arresting Ingle for uttering treasonable words, the
palatine government was not only placing itself
upon the side of King Charles, but was preparing
to do what he had been prevented from doing a
few months before. For when at his command
some persons who had acted treasonably were condemned
to death, parliament declared that &ldquo;all
such indictments and proceedings thereon were
unjust and illegal; and that if any man was
executed or suffered hurt, for any thing he had
done by their order, the like punishment should be
inflicted by death or otherwise, upon such prisoners
as were, or should be, taken by their forces,&rdquo;
and their lives were saved.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The authorities of
Maryland themselves show why Ingle was allowed
to escape. On March 16th, Lewger showed that
&ldquo;whereas Richard Ingle was obnoxious to divers
suits &amp; complaints of his <ins class="abbr" title="Lordship">Lo<sup>p</sup></ins> for divers and sundry
crimes all <ins class="abbr" title="which">w<sup>ch</sup></ins> upon composition for the publique
good &amp; safety were suspended <ins class="abbr" title="against">ag<sup>st</sup></ins> the said Richard
Ingle assuming to leave in the country to the publique
need at this time,&rdquo; powder and shot, but he
had not paid the composition and had left without
paying custom dues, which were required for the
proper discharge of his ship &ldquo;by the law &amp; custom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
of all Ports,&rdquo; he prayed that all of Ingle&rsquo;s goods,
debts, &amp;c., might be sequestered until he should
clear himself.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Under the circumstances, the
grave charges pending against him, as there is no
proof that he had known the terms of composition,
a crew and vessel being at his command, it is not
surprising that he sailed away from danger, without
attending to the formality of clearing, and
leaving unpaid debts, for Lewger claimed 600
pounds of tobacco from him, as payment for some
plate and a scimitar, for which Cornwallis went
security.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> There is a touch of seeming sarcasm in
the suggestion that the deposit by Ingle of ammunition
would have relieved the public need, for he
would have been that much less dangerous, and
the government would have been so much the
more prepared to resist him.</p>

<p>But how were those who assisted him treated?
On January 30th, Thomas Cornwallis, James Neale,
Edward Parker and John Hampton, were impeached
for having rescued him, and thereby of
being accessories to high treason. Cornwallis made
answer, &ldquo;that he did well understand the matters
charged <ins class="abbr" title="against">ag<sup>st</sup></ins> the said Richard Ingle to be of no
importance but suggested of mean malice of
the&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;William hardige, as hath appeared since in
that the grand enquest found not so much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
probability in the accusations, as that it was fitt to putt
him to his triall&rdquo; and &ldquo;he supposed &amp; understood
no other but that the said rich. Ingle went aboard
<ins class="abbr" title="with">w<sup>th</sup></ins> the licence and consent of the L.&nbsp;G. &amp; Counsell
&amp; of the officer in whose custody he was &amp; as to
the escape &amp; rescuous in manner as is charged he
is no way accessory to it &amp; therefore prayeth to be
dismissed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The judgment was delayed, but Cornwallis
was anxious to be at once discharged. The
lieutenant general and the attorney general, therefore,
having consulted together, found Cornwallis
guilty, and fined him one thousand pounds of
tobacco, though at the request of the accused the
fine was respited until the last day of the month,
when Brent ordered the sheriff &ldquo;to levie 1000 lbs
<ins class="abbr" title="tobacco">tob.</ins> on any goods or debts&rdquo; of Capt. <ins class="abbr" title="Thomas">Tho.</ins> Cornwallis
&ldquo;for so much adjudged by way of fine unto
the Lord <ins class="abbr" title="Proprietor">Propriet<sup>r</sup></ins> <ins class="abbr" title="against">ag<sup>st</sup></ins> him at the Court held on
the 9<sup>th</sup> <ins class="abbr" title="ffebruary">ffeb</ins> last.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This fine, which was to be
given to the attorney of Tho. Wyatt, commander
of Kent Island, in payment of Lord Baltimore&rsquo;s
debt to him, Cornwallis afterward acknowledged
he had paid.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Neale did not make his appearance before the
court, though he seems to have been in St. Mary&rsquo;s,
and was suspended from the council for his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
contempt. On February 11th, being accused of having
begged Ingle from the sheriff, he denied all the
charges, and in a few days was restored to his seat
in the council, upon the eve of Brent&rsquo;s departure
for Kent Island.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Parker said Ingle had escaped
against his will, and he was discharged, while
Hampton escaped prosecution, presumably, for
there is no further record of action in the case
against him.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>But it would have been bad policy for the
authorities to allow the matter to drop without
apparent effort on their part to punish somebody,
and Cornwallis had to bear the brunt of their
attacks. The feeling against him was so strong,
according to his own statements, that besides paying
a fine, the highest &ldquo;that could by law be laid
upon him,&rdquo; he was compelled for personal safety
to take ship with Ingle for England, where the
doughty captain testified before a parliamentary
committee of Cornwallis&rsquo; devotion to its cause, and
of the losses he had sustained in its behalf.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The lieutenant governor, and council, may have
congratulated themselves about the departure of
Ingle and Cornwallis, but that mariner and trader
was preparing to return to Maryland. On August
26th, 1644, certain persons trading to Virginia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
petitioned the House of Commons to allow them to
transport ammunition, clothes, and victuals, custom
free, to the plantations of the Chesapeake,
which were at that time loosely classed under the
one name&mdash;Virginia. The Commons granted to
the eight<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> vessels mentioned in the petition, the
right of carrying victuals, clothes, arms, ammunition,
and other commodities, &ldquo;for the supply and
Defence and Relief of the Planters,&rdquo; and referred
the latter part of the petition, asking power to
interrupt the Hollanders and other strange traders,
to the House of Lords.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It is hardly necessary to
say at this point that the planters to be relieved
and defended by the cargoes of the vessels, were
planters not at enmity with the parliament. For
vessels from London were used in the interests of
parliament, while those from Bristol were the
King&rsquo;s ships. De Vries, the celebrated Dutchman,
who has left such acute observations about the
early colonists, wrote that while visiting Virginia
in 1644 he saw two London ships chase a fly-boat
to capture it, and it was reported in Massachusetts
that a captured Indian had given as a reason for
the Indian massacre, on April 18th, 1644, &ldquo;that
they did it because they saw the English took up
all their lands, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and they took this season for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
that they understood that they were at war in
England, and began to go to war among themselves,
for they had seen a fight in the river
between a London ship, which was for the parliament,
and a Bristol ship, which was for the
King.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Among the ships commissioned by the parliament,
which were armed, was the &ldquo;Reformation,&rdquo;
of which Ingle was still master. He was in London
in October, 1644, receiving cargo, and Cornwallis
entrusted to him goods, valued at 200
pounds sterling.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The vessel soon afterwards
sailed, and was in Maryland in February. In
the province, at that time, affairs were in a very
unsettled condition. The energetic Claiborne,
who was also called by Maryland authorities a
pirate and a rebel, but who was a much better
man than is generally supposed, and whose life
ought to be especially studied, was still pushing
his claims to Kent Island, and Leonard Calvert had
been compelled to visit Virginia more than once
during the winter in trying to prevent his actions.
The Indians were aroused and prone to take
advantage of disputes between the factions in the
province, while the colonists themselves were in a
state of unrest. At this juncture Ingle appeared.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
Streeter wrote of his coming, &ldquo;several vessels
appeared in the harbor, from which an armed
force disembarked, (Feb. 14, 1645,) under the
command of Capt. Richard Ingle, St. Mary&rsquo;s was
taken; many of the members were prisoners;
the Governor was a fugitive in Virginia; and the
Province in the hands of a force, professing to act,
and probably acting, under authority of Parliament.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
There is no authority given for the
first part of this statement, though it is not
improbable, and is partly substantiated by the
exaggerated charges against Ingle, made by the
Assembly of 1649, and the references to him in
proclamations. There is no mention in the
provincial records of Calvert&rsquo;s having being forced
out of the province, but, on the contrary, Calvert
in his commission to Hill in 1646 stated that &ldquo;at
this present, I have occasion, for his lordship&rsquo;s
service to be absent out the said province,&rdquo; and
says nothing at all about Ingle. The rebellion has
been called &ldquo;Claiborne&rsquo;s and Ingle&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and,
although association with Claiborne would not
have been dishonorable to any one, historical
accuracy seems to call for a distinction. In
Greene&rsquo;s proclamation of pardon given in March,
1647/8; in the letter written by the Assembly to
Lord Baltimore in April, 1649; in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
Proprietor&rsquo;s commissions for the great seal, for muster
master general, for commander of Kent
Island, respectively, in 1648; and in his letter to
Stone in 1649, the rebellion is attributed to the
instigation of Ingle.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In the commission to
Governor Stone, of August, 1648, is the statement,
&ldquo;so as such pardon or pardons extend not to the
pardoning of William Clayborne heretofore of the
isle of Kent in our said province of Maryland
and now or late of Virginia or of his complices in
their late rebellion against our rights and dominion
in and over the said province nor of Richard
Ingle nor John Durford mariner,&rdquo; and in the act
of Oblivion, in April, 1650, pardon is granted to
all excepting &ldquo;Richard Ingle and John Darford
Marryners, and such others of the Isle of Kent&rdquo;
as were not pardoned by Leonard Calvert.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In
these two instances alone is any kind of an opportunity
offered for connecting the two names, even
here they are separated, and the distinction is
made greater by the fact that in a commission
concerning Hill, also of August, 1648, and in other
places, Claiborne is mentioned with no reference
at all to Ingle.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It is probable, in the absence of
evidence to the contrary, that Ingle and Claiborne
never planned any concerted action, but that each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
took advantage of the other&rsquo;s deeds, to further his
own interests.</p>

<p>To return to the year 1645. The rebellion supposed
to have been originated by Ingle, was
according to statements of the Assembly of 1649,
continued by his accomplices, and during it &ldquo;most of
your Lordships Royal friends here were spoiled of
their whole Estate and sent away as banished persons
out of the Province those few that remained were
plundered and deprived in a manner of all Livelyhood
and subsistance only Breathing under that
intollerable Yoke which they were forced to bear
under those Rebells.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The people were tendered
an oath against Lord Baltimore, which all the
Roman Catholics refused to take, except William
Thompson, about whom there is some doubt.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Ingle, himself, said that he had been able to take
some places from the papists and malignants, and
with goods taken from them had relieved the well-affected
to parliament. Further on in this paper it
will be seen that Roman Catholics&rsquo; property was
attacked under Ingle&rsquo;s auspices, but that the bad
treatment of them did not continue long and was
not very severe, may be inferred from the fact that
in 1646, there were enough members of the council,
who were Roman Catholics, in the province to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
elect Hill governor. In this connection ought to
be mentioned the report, by an uncertain author,
concerning the Maryland mission, written in 1670.
The report is devoted principally to an account of
a miracle which, strange to say, had not been
recorded, as far as is known, although twenty-four
years had elapsed since it had occurred. &ldquo;It has
been established by custom and usage of the Catholics,&rdquo;
the uncertain author wrote, &ldquo;who live in Maryland,
during the whole night of the 31st of July
following the festival of St. Ignatius, to honor with
a salute of cannon their tutelar guardian and
patron saint. Therefore, in the year 1646, mindful
of the solemn custom, the anniversary of the
holy father being ended, they wished the night
also consecrated to the honor of the same, by the
continual discharge of artillery. At the time,
there were in the neighborhood certain soldiers,
unjust plunderers, Englishmen indeed by birth, of
the heterodox faith, who, coming the year before
with a fleet, had invaded with arms, almost the
entire colony, had plundered, burnt, and finally,
having abducted the priests and driven the
Governor himself into exile, had reduced it to a
miserable servitude. These had protection in a
certain fortified citadel, built for their own defence,
situated about five miles from the others; but now,
aroused by the nocturnal report of the cannon, the
day after, that is on the first of August, rush upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
us with arms, break into the houses of the Catholics,
and plunder whatever there is of arms or
powder.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Now this statement bears upon the face
of it a contradiction, for the restriction upon the
Roman Catholics could not have been very great,
since they were allowed to retain, up to August,
1646, the powder and cannon necessary to fire continual
salutes, moreover, when next day the soldiers
came to their dwellings, nothing seems to have been
taken except the ammunition, and this was done
no doubt to prevent any further alarm, that a body
of troops situated as they were might reasonably
have felt at hearing artillery discharges five miles
away.</p>

<p>Many writers have stated that good Fathers White
and Fisher were carried off to England by Ingle,
but from the records of the Jesuits at Stonyhurst,
it is learned that Father White was seized &ldquo;by a
band of soldiers,&rdquo; &ldquo;and carried to England in
chains,&rdquo; and also that in &ldquo;1645 This year the colony
was attacked by a party of &lsquo;rowdies&rsquo; or
marauders and the missioners were carried off to
Virginia.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> These extracts serve to show what was
the confusion existing in the minds of contemporaries
of Ingle, and the extreme difficulty, therefore,
of finding the real truth. But in the sworn statements
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
preserved in the Maryland records, some facts
may be found. Within a few days of the events at
St. Mary&rsquo;s resulting in partial subversion of Baltimore&rsquo;s
government, the &ldquo;Reformation&rdquo; was riding
at the mouth of St. Inigoes&rsquo; creek, near which was
situated the &ldquo;Cross,&rdquo; the manor house of Cornwallis,
who, when he had been obliged in 1644 to leave
Maryland, had left his house and property in the
hands of Cuthbert Fenwick, his attorney.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Fenwick
was intending to go to Accomac, Virginia, and
sent Thomas Harrison, a servant, who had been
bought from Ingle by Cornwallis, and a fellow servant,
<ins class="abbr" title="Edward">Edw.</ins> Matthews, to help Andrew Monroe to
bring a small pinnace nearer the house.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In the
pinnace were clothes, bedding, and other goods, the
property of Fenwick. Monroe refused to bring the
pinnace, and waited until Ingle came into the
creek;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and allowed the pinnace to be captured, (if
that may be called a capture to which consent was
given,) and plundered. Fenwick said that the pinnace
was plundered by &ldquo;Richard Ingle or his associates;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
another witness said that Ingle &ldquo;seized or
plundered&rdquo; the pinnace, and Monroe was employed
by him in his acts against the province, and while
in command of another pinnace assisted in the pillaging
of Copley&rsquo;s house at Portoback.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Matthews
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
as well as other servants were held captives on the
&ldquo;Reformation,&rdquo; and Harrison took up arms for
Ingle and afterwards left the province and fled to
Accomac. Fenwick went on board, no doubt to
protest against such acts, and when he returned to
the shore was seized by a party of men under
John Sturman, who seems to have been a leader in
the rebellion, and carried back to the vessel
where he was kept prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In the meantime
Thomas Sturman, John Sturman, coopers, and
William Hardwick, a tailor, led a party to sack
the dwelling of Cornwallis, who, in a petition to
the Governor and Council in 1652, described it as
&ldquo;a Competent Dwelling house, furnished with
plate, Linnen hangings, beding brass pewter and
all manner of Household Stuff worth at least a
thousand pounds.&rdquo; In the same petition he said
that the party &ldquo;plundered and Carryed away all
things in It, pulled downe and burnt the pales
about it, killed and destroyed all the Swine and
Goates and killed or mismarked allmost all the
Cattle, tooke or dispersed all the Servants,
Carryed away a Great quantity of Sawn Boards
from the pitts, and ript up Some floors of the
house. And having by these Violent and unlawfull
Courses forst away my Said Attorny the Said
Thomas and John Sturman possest themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
of the <ins class="abbr" title="Complainants">Complts</ins> house as theire owne, dwelt in it
Soe long as they please and at their departing
tooke the locks from the doors and y<sup>e</sup> Glass from
the windowes and in fine ruined his whole Estate
to the damage of the <ins class="abbr" title="Complainant">Complt</ins> at least two or three
thousand pounds.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It may be well to bear in
mind that Cornwallis in this petition, which was
against the two Sturmans and Hardwick, who did
not deny the allegations, but claimed the statute
of limitation, no mention is made of Ingle, save
that on his ship Fenwick was detained.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>In the latter part of the year 1645 began the era
of petitions, which should be taken with allowance,
for the age has been characterized as one of perjury,
and in the representations by both parties in
Maryland politics, advantage was taken of every
slight point to strengthen their respective positions,
and from internal evidence it seems that
some statements were garbled, to say the least
about them. The opening of this era was marked
by the presentation, December 25th, 1645, by the
committee of plantations, to the House of Lords,
the following statements and suggestions, viz: that
many had complained of the tyranny of recusants
in Maryland, &ldquo;who have seduced and forced many
of his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects from their religion;&rdquo; that
by a certificate from the Judge of the Admiralty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
grounded upon the deposition of witnesses taken in
that Court: Leonard Calvert, late Governor there,
had a commission from Oxford to seize such
persons, ships and goods as belonged to any of
London; which he registered, proclaimed, and
endeavored to put in execution at Virginia; and
that one Brent, his deputy Governor, had seized
upon a ship, empowered under a commission
derived from the Parliament, because she was of
London, and afterward not only tampered with
the crew thereof to carry her to Bristol, then in
hostility against the Parliament, but also tendered
them an oath against the Parliament; the committee
under these circumstances recommended that
the province should be settled in the hands of protestants.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
This was the first part of the determined
effort to deprive the great Cecil Calvert of his
charter of Maryland, which Richard Ingle continued
so vigorously in after years. He was probably in
England at that time, for he refers to the action
of the Lords in regard to the settling of the Maryland
government, in his petition of February 24th,
1645/6, to the House of Lords. To this petition
was appended a statement on behalf of Cornwallis,
which will explain it. Cornwallis said that on
Ingle&rsquo;s return to England, to cover up his defalcation
in the matter of 200 pounds worth of goods, he
had complained to the committee for examinations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
against Cornwallis as an enemy to the State. The
matter was given a full hearing, and when it was
left to the law and the defendant was granted the
right of having witnesses in Maryland examined,
Ingle had him arrested upon two feigned actions to
the value of 15,000 pounds sterling. Some friends
succeeded in rescuing him from prison, and then
Ingle sent the following petition to the House of
Lords, which had the effect of stopping for the time
proceedings against him.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Having done so he carried
the prosecution no further. The petition is
somewhat lengthy, but it should be read as it is
eminently characteristic of the man.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The humble petition of Richard Ingle, showing
That whereas the petitioner, having taken the covenant,
and going out with letters of marque, as Captain
of the ship Reformation, of London, and sailing
to Maryland, where, finding the Governor of
that Province to have received a commission from
Oxford to seize upon all ships belonging to London,
and to execute a tyrannical power against the Protestants,
and such as adhered to the Parliament,
and to press wicked oaths upon them, and to
endeavor their extirpation, the petitioner, conceiving
himself, not only by his warrant, but in his
fidelity to the Parliament, to be conscientiously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
obliged to come to their assistance, did venture his
life and fortune in landing his men and assisting
the said well affected Protestants against the said
tyrannical government and the Papists and malignants.
It pleased God to enable him to take divers
places from them, and to make him a support to
the said well affected. But since his return to
England, the said Papists and malignants, conspiring
together, have brought fictitious acts against
him, at the common law, in the name of Thomas
Cornwallis and others for pretended trespass, in
taking away their goods, in the parish of St. Christopher&rsquo;s,
London, which are the very goods that
were by force of war justly and lawfully taken from
these wicked Papists and malignants in Maryland,
and with which he relieved the poor distressed
Protestants there, who otherwise must have starved,
and been rooted out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, forasmuch as your Lordships in Parliament
of State, by the order annexed, were pleased
to direct an ordinance to be framed for the settlement
of the said province of Maryland, under the
Committee of Plantations, and for the indemnity of
the actors in it, and for that such false and feigned
actions for matters of war acted in foreign parts,
are not tryable at common law, but, if at all,
before the Court and Marshall; and for that it
would be a dangerous example to permit Papists
and malignants to bring actions of trespass or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
otherwise against the well affected for fighting for
the Parliament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The petitioner most humbly beseecheth your
Lordships to be pleased to direct that this business
may be heard before your Lordships at the bar, or
to refer it to a committee to report the true state of
the case and to order that the said suits against
the petitioner at the common law may be staid,
and no further proceeded in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not known how this matter was settled, but
in 1647, September 8th, Ingle transferred to Cornwallis
&ldquo;for divers good and valuable causes&rdquo; the
debts, bills, &amp;c., belonging to him, and made him
his attorney to collect the same. Among the items
in the inventory appended to the power of attorney
were &ldquo;A Bill and note of John Sturman&rsquo;s, the one
dated the 10th of April 1645 for Satisfaction of
tenn pounds of powder the other dated the 4th of
April 1645 for 900 l of <ins class="abbr" title="Tobacco">Tob</ins> &amp; Caske,&rdquo; and &ldquo;an
<ins class="abbr" title="acknowledgement">acknowledgem<sup>t</sup></ins> of <ins class="abbr" title="Captain">Cap<sup>t</sup></ins> William Stone dated the
10th of April 1645 for a receipt of a Bill of Argall
Yardley&rsquo;s Esq, for 9860 l of Tobacco and Caske,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
which show that the mercantile interests of Ingle
were not subservient to his supposed warlike
measures. A consideration of the statements by
Cornwallis and of those by Ingle, proves that the
latter must have had considerable influence in
the Parliament, and that he was prepared to stand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
by and defend all his actions, and the similarity
to his petition of ideas and even of words in certain
places, would safely allow the conjecture that Ingle
had something to do in the report of 1645 already
mentioned. It is curious also to compare his
reference to the ill-treatment of the Protestants,
and the mention of the hardships of Baltimore&rsquo;s
adherents, made by the Assembly of 1649. There
is no record of the presence of Ingle in Maryland
after the spring of 1645, though the rebellion which
he was accused of instigating continued some
months longer.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> For continuity, a rapid sketch
of the history of Maryland during the next two
years must be given.</p>

<p>For fourteen months the province was without a
settled government. In March, 1645/6, the Virginian
Assembly in view of the secret flight into
Maryland of Lieutenant Stillwell, and others,
enacted that &ldquo;Capt. Tho. Willoughby, Esq., and
Capt. Edward Hill be hereby authorized to go to
Maryland or Kent to demand the return of such
persons who are alreadie departed from the colony.
And to follow such further instructions as shall be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
given them by the Governor and Council.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> After
Hill had arrived in Maryland he was elected
governor by the members of the council, who,
notwithstanding Ingle&rsquo;s rebellion, were in the
province. The right of the council to elect Hill
was afterwards disputed, but one word must be
said in regard to this. The reason for disputing
the right was that the councilors could elect only
a member of the council to be governor. In the
commission to Leonard Calvert in 1637, no such
restriction was made,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> in the commission of 1642
the restriction occurs, and in the commission of
1644, which has been preserved in two copies, the
same provision was made.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> As Lord Baltimore
himself had confused ideas about this commission,
it is not surprising that the council thought they
were doing right in electing Hill. Even if the
council had no right to act thus, Hill had stronger
claims to the governorship. In Lord Baltimore&rsquo;s
commission to Leonard Calvert, of September 18th,
1644, is the provision:<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> &ldquo;and lastly whereas our
said Lieutenant may happen to dye or be absent
from time to time out of the said province of Maryland,
before we can have notice to depute another
in his place we do therefore hereby grant unto
him full power and Authority from time to time in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
such Cases to Nominate elect and appoint such an
able person inhabiting and residing within our said
province of <ins class="abbr" title="Maryland">Maryl<sup>d</sup></ins>, as he in his discretion shall
make choice of &amp; think fit to be our Lieutenant
Governor, &amp;c.&rdquo; Such is the command as recorded
in the Council Proceedings of Maryland. But
Baltimore, in 1648, in a commission to the
Governor and council in Maryland, wrote that
Leonard Calvert had no right to appoint any
person in his stead &ldquo;unless such persons were of
our privy council there,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> although he recognized
the validity of Leonard&rsquo;s death-bed appointment
by witnesses of Governor Greene. He, to
be sure, was a member of the council, but this
fact was not mentioned in the preamble of the
commission, in which the words, with some slight
changes in tense and mood, are almost identical
with those in the preamble of the commission of
July 30th, 1646, from Calvert to Hill, which, notwithstanding
doubts to the contrary, must have
been genuine. For Lord Baltimore, in the commission
of 1648 seems to have acknowledged
that his brother had granted the commission to
Hill,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> who, in a letter to Calvert, said that he had
promised him one-half the customs and rents, the
remuneration stipulated in his commission. Hill,
not knowing that Calvert was dead, wrote him a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
letter, dated June 18th, 1647, urging the payment
of his dues, and the next day Greene, the new
Governor, replied that he did not understand the
matter, but that if Hill would send an attorney &ldquo;full
satisfaction should be given him.&rdquo; When Hill
wrote next he waived the authority of Calvert,
and based his claim upon the right of the council
to elect him, and in this way placed himself upon
an illegal footing, which circumstance was taken
advantage of for a time by the Maryland authorities.
But finally at a court held June 10th, 1648,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
one year after Calvert&rsquo;s death, a claim from Hill
was presented &ldquo;for Arrears of what consideration
was Covenanted unto him by Leonard Calvert,
Esq., for his Service in the office of Governor of
this Province, being the half of his <ins class="abbr" title="Lordships">Ldps</ins> rents
for the year 1646 &amp; the half of the Customes for
the Same yeare.&rdquo; It was ordered by the court,
&ldquo;that ye half of that yeares Customes as far as it
hath not already been received by Capt. Hill
shall be paid unto him by the <ins class="abbr" title="Lord Proprietors">Ld Prop<sup>rs</sup></ins> Attorny
out of the first profitts which shall be receivable
to his <ins class="abbr" title="Lordship">Ldp</ins> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* his <ins class="abbr" title="Lordships">Ldps</ins> Receiver shall accompt
&amp; pay unto <ins class="abbr" title="Captain">Cap<sup>t</sup></ins> Edward Hill or his assignes the
one halfe of his <ins class="abbr" title="Lordships">Ldps</ins> rents due at Christmas next
in Lieu of the <ins class="abbr" title="Said">S<sup>d</sup></ins> rents of the yeare 1646 which
were otherwise disposed of to his <ins class="abbr" title="Lordships">Ldps</ins> use.&rdquo;
There is, however, one fact which must not be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
lost sight of in regard to Leonard Calvert&rsquo;s commission
to Hill. If it was executed by a member
of the council, and therefore was a forgery, for in
the records Calvert&rsquo;s name is signed to it, and
the place of the seal is noted, it is not at all
likely that it would have been allowed by Calvert
on his return, and by his immediate successors, to
be preserved and copied into the records. If all
other proof failed this last would establish the
validity of Hill&rsquo;s commission.</p>

<p>But Calvert, who, throughout his whole career
as governor of Maryland, showed unchanging
devotion to his brother&rsquo;s interests, gathered in
Virginia a body of soldiers and returned at the
end of 1646 to St. Mary&rsquo;s, where he easily repossessed
himself of that part of the country, though
Kent Island remained still in possession of
Claiborne&rsquo;s forces. Thus was ended what has been
called Ingle&rsquo;s rebellion, in which the loss of the
lord proprietor&rsquo;s personal estate &ldquo;was in truth so
small as that it was not Considerable when it was
come in Ballance with the Safety of the Province
which as the then present Condition of things
stood, hung upon so ticklish a pin as that unless
such a disposition had been made thereof an
absolute ruin and subversion of the whole Province
would inevitably have followed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Another proof
of Hill&rsquo;s regular appointment is that Calvert on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
the 29th of December, soon after his return,
re-assembled the Assembly, which Hill had summoned
and adjourned, and proceeded with it to
enact laws.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Although a later Assembly in 1648
protested against the laws passed by this
Assembly, the proprietor recognized them as
valid, and wrote in 1649 that it had been &ldquo;lawfully
continued&rdquo; by his brother &ldquo;ffor although the
first Sumons were issued by one who was not our
Lawfull Lieutenant there, yet being afterwards
approved of by one that was, it is all one, as to
the proceedings afterward as if at first they had
issued from a lawfull Governor.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The writer is
no lawyer, but it seems, that, if the Assembly of
Hill was &ldquo;lawfully continued&rdquo; and &ldquo;approved&rdquo; by
Calvert, the recognition by Baltimore must have
been legally retroactive, and, therefore, that the
laws passed before Calvert&rsquo;s return must have been
legally valid, saving of course the proprietor&rsquo;s
dissent. Leonard Calvert having spent some
months in settling the affairs of the province
died, June 9th, 1647, and Greene ruled in his stead.
In the following March, Ingle&rsquo;s name again
appears in the records. The governor, on March
4th, 1648, proclaimed pardon to all except
Richard Ingle, and in August of the same year
the lord proprietor issued, besides his commissions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
to Governor Stone, to the council and to secretary
Thomas Hatton, commissions, for the Great Seal,
for muster master general, and for commander of
the Isle of Kent. John Price was made muster
master general for his &ldquo;great Fidelity unto us in
that Occasion of the late insurrection and Rebellion
in our said province was begun there by
that Notorious Villain Richard Ingle and his
Complices,&rdquo; and Robert Vaughan was appointed
commander of Kent for the same reason.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Then
in 1650 was passed the act of Oblivion, excepting
Ingle, Durford, and some of the Isle of Kent. In
1649, Baltimore granted to James Lindsey and
Richard Willan certain lands, and directed that
in the grants should be inserted the notice &ldquo;of
their singular and approved worth courage and
fidelity (in Ingle&rsquo;s insurrection) to the end a
memory of their merit and of his (the Proprietor)
sense thereof may remain upon record to the
honour of them and their posterity forever.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>An investigation into Ingle&rsquo;s doings at this
time may explain the bitter terms in which he is
mentioned in the official records of Maryland,
and also why upon him was foisted the chief
responsibility for the disturbances. During the
year 1646, Lord Baltimore was engaged in defending
his charter, against the justice of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
such grave charges had been brought by Ingle
and others, in the winter of 1645/6. On January
23rd, 1646/7, application in Baltimore&rsquo;s behalf, was
made to the House of Lords, that the depositions
of witnesses made before the Admiralty Court
in regard to Maryland should be read. In a few
weeks Baltimore begged that the actions looking
to the repeal of his charter might be delayed,
and on the same day certain merchants in London,
who were interested in the Virginia trade,
requested that the ordinance should be sent to
the Commons, for Baltimore&rsquo;s petition was
intended only to cause delay.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The matter was
stayed for the time, but by December, 1649, Ingle
had sent to the Council of State a petition and
remonstrance against the government of Lord
Baltimore&rsquo;s colony. The hearing, which was
referred to the Committee of the Admiralty, was
postponed until January 10th, 1650, when Baltimore&rsquo;s
agent requested it to be deferred until
the 16th. Witnesses were summoned and upon
Baltimore&rsquo;s appearance, he was ordered to make
answer in writing to Ingle by the 30th. On January
29th the matter was again postponed until
February 6th, &ldquo;in respect of extraordinary occasions
not permitting them to hear the same to-morrow.&rdquo;
Delay followed delay until March 1st,
when Ingle was &ldquo;unprovided to prove&rdquo; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
charges against Lord Baltimore for misconduct
in the government of Maryland, but on the 15th
of the same month, &ldquo;after several debates of the
business depending between Capt. Ingle and Lord
Baltimore, touching a commission granted to
Leonard Calvert, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* by the late King at Oxford
in 1643&rdquo; the advocate for the State and the
attorney general were directed to examine the
validity of the original charter to Cecil, Lord
Baltimore. Allusion to this matter was again
made in the records, but nothing showing its
result unless it be the order of the Council of
State, of December 23d, 1651, that Lord Baltimore
should be allowed to &ldquo;pursue his cause according
to law.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Ingle seems to have been at this time in the service
of what was once a parliament, but which had
been reduced in 1648, by Pride&rsquo;s purge, to about
sixty members. In February, 1650, he informed
the Council of State that on board two ships, the
&ldquo;&lsquo;Flower de Luce&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Thomas and John,&rsquo;
were persons bound to Virginia, who were enemies
of the Commonwealth.&rdquo; The vessels were stayed
for over a month, when they were allowed to sail
down to Gravesend, where, before they left for Virginia,
the mayor and justices were to &ldquo;take the
superscription of passengers and mariners not to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
engage against the Commonwealth.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In April
of this year the Council of State ordered the
payment to Ingle of &pound;30 sterling for services and
care in keeping Captain Gardner, who had been
arrested for treason, in having tried to betray
Portland Castle.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> He again comes into notice
in 1653, by some letters written by him to Edward
Marston. He had been cast away by shipwreck
in the Downs, and was then at Dover, where he
had been very ill. Having heard that two prizes
which he had helped to secure, had been condemned
and that the rest of the men had obtained
their shares, he wrote to secure the eleven shares
due him, and told Marston to send one part to
his wife, and the other to him. On November 14th,
he again wrote that he had received no answer
although &ldquo;I have written you every post these
3 weeks, having been sick my want of money is
great.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> This is the last fact, which can at present
be found, about Richard Ingle, who first came into
notice demanding tobacco debts, and is discovered,
at last demanding prize money. These two acts
were typical of the man, he was always on the
lookout for gain and yet remained a staunch
adherent to the Long Parliament, which did so
much to strengthen English liberties, but whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
acts led to such extreme measures as those which
culminated in the execution of the self-willed
unfortunate Charles I.</p>

<p>By a careful consideration of all the facts, it
will be seen that the acts of Richard Ingle are
in some cases legendary, and as such naturally
have become more heinous with every successive
account. The endeavor has been in this
paper to give an unprejudiced historical account
of his life, but in view of the mis-statements about
him, it still remains to sum up, and examine the
specific charges against him. He is accused of
having stolen the silver seal of the province.
Lord Baltimore&rsquo;s own statements, however, concerning
it are doubtful. &ldquo;Whereas our great seal of the
said province of Maryland was treacherously and
violently taken away from thence by Richard
Ingle or his complices in or about February,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
1644/5,&rdquo; he wrote in August, 1648. Nothing
had been said according to the records up to
that time in Maryland about the loss of the seal.
On the contrary, in a commission given by Governor
Greene on July 4th, 1647, over a year before
the proprietor&rsquo;s commission for the great seal,
are the words, &ldquo;Given under my hand and the
Seal of the province.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and in the proclamation
of March 4th, 1648, Greene promised pardon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
&ldquo;under my hand and the seal of the province,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
to all out of the province except Ingle, who should
confess their faults before a certain date.</p>

<p>It may be urged against these facts that
&ldquo;under my hand and the seal of the province,&rdquo;
was mere legal phraseology. But those which
have been given are the only two instances of the
use of the term from 1646 to 1648, and are both
preceded and followed by commissions, &amp;c., ending
&ldquo;and this shall be your commission,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;given at St. Mary&rsquo;s,&rdquo; in which, if the term was
merely technical language, why was it not more
frequently used? Again, it may be said that it
was a temporary seal. If it were, it is strange
that no mention is made of the fact in the records
of the province, or in Lord Baltimore&rsquo;s commission
for the new seal. It was hoped and desired
that in this paper no occasion would arise to make
accusations against any of Ingle&rsquo;s opponents, but
historic truth now requires it to be done. It must
be remembered that Baltimore was in constant
danger of losing his charter, in a great measure,
on account of Ingle&rsquo;s activity against him. Upon
his authority alone is based the charge against
Ingle about the seal, but of how much value is
the authority of one who, at the very same time
and in a commission sent out with that of the
seal, wrote that Leonard Calvert &ldquo;was limited by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
our commission to him not to appoint&rdquo; any person
governor &ldquo;unless such person were of our privy
council there,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> although no such limitation as to
the governor&rsquo;s right was made in any of the commissions
to Leonard Calvert so this clause in
the lord proprietor&rsquo;s commission resolves itself
into a Machiavellian statement. It is hardly
credible that Lord Baltimore could have made
such a statement from ignorance, for no one knew
the commission better than the author of it. But
notwithstanding the evidence against Lord Baltimore,
the writer has too high an opinion of his
character to attribute to him the diplomatic
lie. Lord Baltimore was no doubt influenced a
great deal, by what was reported to him concerning
Maryland, so the blame must rest upon his
informers. Still if these persons would resort to
such methods in one case, they would be likely to
do so in other instances. Whoever was the author
of the statement, it throws doubt upon other supposed
facts of this period, and leads to the conclusion
that the commission for a new seal was one
of the reconstructive acts of the proprietor, on a
par with the treatment of Hill.</p>

<p>Ingle has been charged with the destruction of
the records of the province. What was Baltimore&rsquo;s
opinion? &ldquo;We understand&rdquo; he wrote in
1651, &ldquo;that in the late Rebellion there One thousand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
Six hundred Forty and four most of the Records
of that province being then lost or embezzled.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
This hearsay statement of Lord Baltimore may
have been based upon the testimony in 1649, of
Thomas Hatton, Secretary of the province, of the
receipt of books from Mr. Bretton, who &ldquo;delivered
to me this Book, and another lesser Book with a
Parchment Cover, divers of the Leaves thereof
being cut or torn out, and many of them being

divers other Papers and Writings bound together in
a Bundle,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and swore that they were all the documents
belonging to the secretary or register which
could be found, &ldquo;except some Warrants, and some
Draughts of Mr. <em>Hill&rsquo;s</em> Time.&rdquo; All the records,
therefore, were not destroyed, but in 1649, there
were in existence papers belonging to the Hill
regime. But greater proofs against the vandalism
of Ingle are the records themselves, or the copies
of them, which could not have been made if the
originals had been destroyed, and which have at
last been deposited where thieves do not break
through nor steal. There have been preserved
among the records up to 1647, the original proprietary
record books, liber Z., 1637-1644 and
liber P.&nbsp;R., 1642 to February 12, 1645. The
Council Proceedings, 1636-1657, the Assembly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
Proceedings, 1638-1658, and liber F., 1636-1642,
proprietary records, have been handed down in
copies. The loss of liber F., 1636-1642, can no more
be attributed to Ingle than can the loss of liber
K., 1692-1694, which was made fifty years after
Ingle&rsquo;s time. Both of these, as well as records
of later years, have been preserved in copies
only, but a brief study of the Calendar of State
Archives, prefixed to the Acts of Assembly, will
demonstrate that the destruction of records by
Ingle could not have been so great as has been
supposed. But did he destroy any? There are
gaps in the records, that exist between February
14, 1645, when the rebellion occurred, and December,
1646, when Calvert returned, but it is not
likely that under the existing circumstances very
great care was taken of the records of these twenty-two
months, and moreover there is no proof that
Ingle was in the province after 1645, for he was
probably in London in December of that year,
and certainly in the following February. His
appointing Cornwallis his attorney for collecting
Maryland and Virginia debts would also lead one
to believe that he did not return to the province.
Some of the records of the Hill government, however,
were in existence in 1649, but as far as is
known have since disappeared. Ingle certainly
did not destroy them, and indeed to a man
engaged in the tobacco trade, there were few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
inducements to waste his time, and that of his
men cutting up records.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand why Lord Baltimore
should have called Ingle an &ldquo;ungrateful villain,&rdquo;
for the reception the latter met at St. Mary&rsquo;s in
1644, was not calculated to inspire one with gratitude.
The compensation offered Ingle might have
been deemed liberal, but the Maryland authorities
acknowledged that they had to make this offer for
the public good and safety, and, therefore, no particular
credit can be given them for kindness
towards the troublesome mariner. But the relations
between Ingle and Cornwallis are rather
perplexing. The latter accused Ingle of not
returning the value of goods entrusted to him,
and also of landing, during his absence, &ldquo;some
men near his house,&rdquo; and rifling &ldquo;him to the
value of 2,500 l at least.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> All this was done after
Cornwallis had showed his devotion to Parliament,
by releasing Ingle. It must be remembered in
connection with the devotion to Parliament, that
Ingle was doing the great carrying trade for Cornwallis.
Besides, after Ingle had made him his
attorney, he went to Maryland and there sued
three men for the pillage and destruction of his
property, without implicating Ingle. In the
absence of full records concerning these two men,
it is unfair to judge either of them harshly in this
matter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
The indefinite allusion to Ingle&rsquo;s piracy in 1644
was not sustained, but in 1649 he was again called
&ldquo;pirate.&rdquo; The definition of piracy has undergone
many changes within the past three hundred years.
From robbery committed upon the high seas, it
has come to mean, &ldquo;acts of violence done upon
the ocean or unappropriated lands or within the
territory of a state through descent from the sea, by
a body of men acting independently of any political
or organized society.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The pirate has also
been held as an enemy, whom the whole human
race can oppress. These definitions are from the
international standpoint. What was the English
law at the time of Ingle? The treatment of
pirates was regulated by the Act of Parliament,
made in the reign of Henry VIII.,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and Sir Leoline
Jenkins, on September 2d, 1668, at a session of
the Admiralty, said, &ldquo;now robbery as &rsquo;tis distinguished
from thieving or larceny, implies not
only the actual taking away of my goods, while I
am, as we say, in peace, but also the putting me
in fear, by taking them away by force and arms
out of my hands, or in my sight and presence,
when this is done upon the sea, without a lawful
commission of war or reprisals, it is downright
Piracy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> In the Assembly of March, 1638,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
piracy was defined as follows: &ldquo;William dawson
with divers others did assault the vessels of Capt.
Thomas Cornwaleys his company feloniously and
as pyrates &amp; robbers to take the said vessels
and did discharge divers peices charged wi<sup>th</sup> bulletts
&amp; shott against the said Thomas Cornwaleys,
&amp;c.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Granted, although it is doubtful, that
Ingle seized the pinnace, riding in St. Inigoes&rsquo;
creek, he was not, therefore, a pirate. According
to the testimony, he used no force, for the one in
charge of the pinnace allowed him to take it; and
the act was not committed on the high seas. For
the acts committed on the land, Ingle acknowledged
himself to have been responsible; for in
his petition he wrote, that he &ldquo;did venture his life
and fortune in landing his men and assisting the
said well-affected Protestants (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, such as adhered
to Parliament)&rdquo; against the government, the
papists and malignants. His acts on the land
were rather contradictory, if one reads the testimony.
In 1647, for instance, a certain Walter
Beane<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> at the request of Cuthbert Fenwick, said
that during the plundering time, with the consent
of Fenwick, he paid Ingle some tobacco, which
was due Fenwick or Cornwallis. Ingle then gave
him the following, &ldquo;Received of Walter Beane
five <ins class="abbr" title="hundred">hund<sup>r</sup></ins> Thirty Eight pounds of <ins class="abbr" title="Tobacco">Tob</ins> for a debt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
<ins class="abbr" title="that">th<sup>t</sup></ins> the <ins class="abbr" title="said">s<sup>d</sup></ins> Walter Beane did owe to Cuthbert ffenwick.
Witness my hand,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap"><ins class="abbr" title="Richard">Rich<sup>d</sup>.</ins> Ingle</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beane stated also that sometime before Ingle
came, he paid six hogsheads of tobacco to Fenwick
for Cornwallis, and that Ingle, upon his
arrival, sent eleven men to fetch the hogsheads
and other tobacco; that when Beane refused to
give them up, Ingle was notified, and sent a note
threatening extreme measures, and Beane was
thus forced to give up the tobacco. Does it not
seem curious that Ingle should give a receipt for
one batch of tobacco, and within a short time have
other tobacco forcibly seized? Of course the
authorities of Maryland might have considered
such acts piratical. But they were not. Ingle
had a commission from Parliament, to relieve the
planters in Maryland, by furnishing them arms,
&amp;c. He found the government of Maryland at
enmity with Parliament, which was the actual
government of England at that time, and assisted
the friends of Parliament in Maryland. Even
if he exceeded the provisions of his letter of
marque he was responsible to Parliament alone.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
That the English authorities did not disapprove
of his conduct is shown by the weight attached to
his statements, and by the fact that he was afterwards
in the service of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
As to Ingle&rsquo;s having been a &ldquo;rebel,&rdquo; the facts
all point to his participation in the beginning of a
rebellion, caused probably, by those dissatisfied
with Leonard Calvert&rsquo;s rule, more probably by the
influence of William Claiborne, who in spite of
condemnatory acts by the Maryland Assembly,
and the vacillating measures of Charles I., insisted
for many years upon his right to Kent Island.
But rebellion is viewed in different ways: by those
against whom it is made, with horror and detestation;
by those who make it, with pride and ofttimes
with devotion. If Ingle led on the rebellion,
he was acting in Maryland, only as Cromwell
afterwards did on a larger scale, in England,
and as Bacon, the brave and noble, did in Virginia,
and to be placed in the same category with
many, who will be handed down to future generations
as rebels, will be no discredit to the first
Maryland rebel.</p>
